# KitKatCat-personal-project-
A web application. Given an image of a cat, the program will transform the image so that the catâ€™s body, face, and shape is covered in a Kit-Kat candy wrapper!

The goal of this project is to: 

- teach me HTML/CSS

- learn more about Machine Learning and branches of it

- have fun :)
