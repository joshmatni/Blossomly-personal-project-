# KitKatCat-personal-project-
A web application. Given an image of a cat, the program will transform the image so that the catâ€™s body, face, and shape is covered in a Kit-Kat candy wrapper!

The goal of this project is to: 

- teach me HTML/CSS

- learn more about Machine Learning and branches of it

- have fun :)



tentative schedule for my project:

Day 1: Research and Planning
Understand the problem I am trying to solve.
Research about image recognition, segmentation, and transformation.
Start looking for datasets for training my model.

Day 2 - 5: Learn and Understand the Basic Concepts
Learn about convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Understand how they can be used for image recognition and segmentation.
Learn about generative adversarial networks (GANs). Understand how they can be used for image transformation.

Day 6 - 9: Dataset Collection and Preparation
Collect and prepare datasets for my task.
I'll need a dataset of cat images, and a separate dataset of Kit-Kat textures.
Preprocess the images for my tasks: normalization, resizing, etc.

Day 10 - 14: Building the Cat Detector
Start by implementing a CNN for cat detection. I can find pre-trained models (like YOLO, SSD, etc.) and fine-tune them with my cat dataset.
Evaluate and optimize my model.

Day 15 - 19: Building the Cat Segmenter
Use CNN for image segmentation task. Models like Mask R-CNN can be a good starting point.
Evaluate and optimize my model.

Day 20 - 24: Building the Kit-Kat Transformer
Use a GAN for image transformation. Models like Pix2Pix or CycleGAN can be used for this.
Evaluate and optimize my model.

Day 25 - 26: Combine the models
Now that I have a cat detector, a cat segmenter, and a Kit-Kat transformer, combine these three models to create my final application.

Day 27 - 29: Testing and Debugging
Test my complete model on new images. Debug any issues that arise.

Day 30: Final adjustments and Review
Make any final adjustments
